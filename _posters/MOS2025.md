This poster was presented at [the 15th National Conference on Mathematical Optimization (MOS 2025)](https://conf.orsc.org.cn/conferences/), organized by the Mathematical Programming Branch of the Operations Research Society of China.

It summarizes our proposed CACI-PG method, which incorporates conflict-aware gradient aggregation and curvature-informed proximal updates for composite multi-objective optimization. Click [here](/files/posters/Yiyang_MOS2025_poster.pdf) to view the poster.
