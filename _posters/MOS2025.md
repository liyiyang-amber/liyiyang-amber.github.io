This poster was presented at the 2025 National Conference on Operations Research (MOS 2025), organized by the Operations Research Society of China. You can find more about the event [here](https://conf.orsc.org.cn/conferences/).

It summarizes our proposed CACI-PG method, which incorporates conflict-aware gradient aggregation and curvature-informed proximal updates for composite multi-objective optimization.
