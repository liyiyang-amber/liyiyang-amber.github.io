The moment the plane descended, I knew Norway was different. Other places spread out in logical grids—cities, mountains, rivers stitching them together—but here, the world fractured into emerald islands scattered like broken jewelry. Tiny kingdoms, each with a single house crowned in pine trees, floating in water so dark it looked like spilled ink. Maps hinted at it, but nothing prepared me for the quiet chaos of beauty.

The tram rattled through streets washed in liquid silver by sudden rain.  Bergen’s wooden houses wore graffiti like lipstick stains—playful, unexpected.  Then came the hail, sending me fleeing into McDonald’s.

When I emerged, the sky was a promise half-kept: blue gasping between clouds, I climbed toward the forest.

No Google Maps. Just blind faith and a local’s grin.

“Follow me,” he said, “I’ll show you real Norway.”

We walked beneath pines older than heartbreak, and I confessed how Asian artists romanticized these woods.  “What do they say? ” he asked.  "In the velvet dusk of love, the forest hides the heart's untouchable shadows, whispering lonely longing too wild to tame," I replied. 

That this forest looks exactly like fairy tales promise. A kingdom of emerald where moss grew thick as velvet carpets, where ancient trees stretched so high they vanished into the sky. Their roots formed arched bridges over whispering streams, while sunlight fell through the canopy like liquid gold — It feels like magic might spark in the air at any moment.

Troll carvings from Norwegian fairytales hid in the bark, placed to lure children deeper into the wild. At the viewpoint, tindal rays pierced the clouds like a spotlight for this small town.

“Last month,” he said, “these bushes dripped blueberries.”  He scavenged one orphaned berry for me.  It tasted like sunlight and soil - nothing like supermarket plastic.

“First meal was McDonald’s?”  He feigned horror.  “Shaaaaame.  Try this.”  The reindeer sausage sang—smoky, gamey, with fruit jam—a surprising symphony of flavors.
