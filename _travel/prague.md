By noon, I was horizontal in a hotel room, watching sunlight pool on the floor like spilled Prosecco, learning about the Astronomical Clock from a vlog. It’s beautiful, the narrator insisted, but mostly it’s a tourist trap that’s been repaired for 600 years. I loved it immediately.

Outside, trams and cars shared the same rails — an elegant chaos, though the traffic wasn’t chaotic at all.

On Charles Bridge, a statue of three saints: two locked in a gaze, the third staring blankly into the distance. Typical, I thought. There’s always one who doesn’t get the memo.

That night, the moon hung over the Vltava like a cheap pendant.
