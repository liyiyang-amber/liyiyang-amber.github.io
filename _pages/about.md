Hi, my name is Li Yiyang (Amber), a first-year PhD student in Applied Mathematics at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. My research is centred on developing advanced solutions for multi-objective optimisation problems, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical mathematics and practical applications in ML and other fields. I hold a BSc in Mathematics and an MSc in Statistics (Data Science) from Imperial College London.

**Oh right—before I forget, my core identity in the following years: PhD student!!!!!!!**

Now in the following, you'll find a whimsical bit more about me:
